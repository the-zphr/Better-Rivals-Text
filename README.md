# Better Rivals Text mod for NFS Rivals
<sup>Created by [Zephyr](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClBKsNkyF5kMl-6-Iv6QFtg), the Leader of Heated</sup>

## What does it change?
This mod **overhauls the game's text** in a rather entertaining way. It also **mentions** some of this game's **commonly known issues and problems**.

## How can I contribute to it?
You can **report spelling errors**, **suggest per-line changes** or **translate the mod to other languages**.
> [!NOTE]
> This mod currently only works with the english language, so make sure your **in-game language is set properly.**

## How can I report spelling errors?
To do that, create an [Issue](https://github.com/the-zphr/Better-Rivals-Text/issues) and provide required information.

## How can I suggest per-line changes/translate it?
Follow the guide below; there is also a [video](https://youtu.be/bO7HPa57f_E) that explains it visually. <br>
<sub>that link is a joke, but it explains how to use github (editor's note: no it doesn't unless you can read in 480p)</sub>

# Contributing

Prerequisites:
- Frosty Editor (or any software capable of editing .CSV files, such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download); Frosty Editor is highly recommended because you can launch the game directly with the mod injected and it makes editing easier by showing you which lines are/aren't modified).
- Frosty Mod Manager (optional; use it if you want to use your submission with other mods).
> [!NOTE]
> Frosty's tools can be found [here](https://github.com/CadeEvs/FrostyToolsuite/releases).

  <summary>Step 1 (choosing)</summary>

**Choose the way of contributing you'd like**. If it's **suggesting single line changes**, you need the "**(unmodded)**" file. If it's **translating**, then you'd want to download the **regular** file.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Step 2 (downloading)</summary>

If you chose **per-line changes**, download the "**[version] (unmodded).csv**" **file** from the directory you want (for example [**BRT 0.3a1 (unmodded).csv**](0.3%20Alpha%20releases/0.3a1/BRT%200.3a1%20(unmodded).csv) from [**0.3 Alpha releases/0.3a1**](0.3%20Alpha%20releases/0.3a1)). However, if you chose **translating**, download the file *without* "**(unmodded)**" in the filename.

  <summary>Step 3.1 (editing via Frosty Editor)</summary>
  
**Open Frosty Editor** and **open LSE** (**View** > **Localized String Editor**).

Then, click "**Import String List**" and **select the downloaded file**.

![Importing the CSV file](resources/images/Importing_the_CSV_file.png)
- for per-line changes: From the dropdown menu on the left of the LSE window choose "Show only **modified** strings". Here you can start editing the list to your own liking. 
- for translating: From the dropdown menu on the left of the LSE window choose "Show only **unmodified** strings". Here you can start translating the already modified lines.

<details>
  <summary>Step 3.2 (editing via VS Code)</summary>
  
Open VS Code and open the **downloaded file**. From here you can easily find lines by using the Find feature (**CTRL + F**). 

![Find and replace](resources/images/Find_and_replace.png)

After you're done, remember to **save the changes made in the file (CTRL + S).**

<details>
  <summary>Step 4 (submitting)</summary>

If you're using FE: make sure the list shows only **modified** lines, then click **Export String List** and make sure to save it as a .CSV file.
If you're using VS Code: simply save the file and you're done.
Now, to actually submit it, create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/the-zphr/Better-Rivals-Text/pulls) and attach your modified .CSV file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - do NOT change HEX values as it WILL break the affected lines (UNLESS you're swapping them).
> - when you're done with one of the 3rd step's parts, **make sure to save the changes (CTRL + S)** to your .fbproject file (if you want to use it as a mod later on).
> - after modifying a line, click "Update" above the text input window. Otherwise, your change won't be applied.
>
> ![Applying](resources/images/Applying.png)
> - when submitting, put the version along with the language (if it applies) in the filename.
